\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The Pythagoras Tree is a fractal constructed by taking a unit square and then recursively constructing 2 copies of the Pythagoras tree each scaled by a factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$ and rotated $45^\circ$ so that the bases of the copies of the original square form a right-angled isosceles triangle with the top edge of the original square.

In this paper, we show that the shape can be decomposed into squares from a finite set, each of which can be split into 4 elements of the same set. This gives rise to a system of linear equations which can be solved to give an exact rational number for the area of the shape.

Let $d_0$ be the transformation which rotates 45 degrees anticlockwise and scales by $1/\sqrt{2}$ centered on $(-1,1)$
and let $d_1$ be the transformation which rotates 45 degrees clockwise and scales by $1/\sqrt{2}$ centered on $(2,1)$.

We define the \emph{depth 1 rendering} of the Pythagoras tree to consist of a unit square with opposite corners at $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, and the depth $n+1$ rendering to consist of 2 copies of the depth $n$ rendering transformed by $d_0$ and $d_1$ together with the unit square of the depth 1 rendering. This gives the arrangement described in Sec. \ref{sec:intro}. The Pythagoras tree is the union of the set of finite depth renderings.


This paper sets out to find the exact area of the Pythagoras tree, which we will denote $A$. $A$ is the limit of the sequence of the areas of the depth $n$ renderings.
This sequence starts $1,2,3,4,5,5 {15\over 16},6 {53\over 64},\cdots$. The limit of this monotone sequence exists since it is bounded above by the area of a $7 \times 4$ rectangle which no part of the shape leaves.

\subsection{Closure}
Whether the squares are open or closed has no effect on the area of a finite depth rendering, therefore has no effect on the limit of the sequence of areas. Since the Pythagoras tree is not closed, even if closed squares are used rather than open ones, 
Whether the closure of the limit of the sequence has a different area from the limit of the sequence is a different question that could be addressed directly, but will be shown to be false in the process of finding the area. 

\begin{remark}
	It is tempting to say (for convenience when dealing with automata) that the axis-aligned squares (added at odd depths) are closed while the other squares are open, but that smells a bit.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Describing shapes by Automata}

\end{wrapfigure}

Certain subsets of a unit square can be represented by dividing the square into 4 corners and describing what each looks like. For shapes in which parts are copies of the whole, this can be done using a finite state automaton with the alphabet consisting of 4 symbols: tl (top left), tr (top right), bl (bottom left) and br (bottom right). For example, the triangle shown to the left can be described by the automaton below it. The top left and bottom right corners are smaller copies of the triangle, while the bottom left and top right corners are full and empty respectively.

This representation lets us calculate the area of the triangle. Call the area of the triangle $A_T$. Since the area of the triangle is the sum of the areas of each of the 4 corners, we have that $A_T = A_F/4 + 2A_T/4 + A_E/4$ where $A_F$ is the area of a full square and $A_E$ is the area of an empty square. As $A_F=1$ and $A_E=0$, the equation becomes $A_T = 1/4 + A_T/2$. This lets us conclude that $A_T = 1/2$ i.e. the area of the triangle is exactly half that of the unit square.

\begin{remark}
	Technically we're using $\omega$-automata, which accept or reject infinite strings identifying points in a unit square according to whether the point is in the shape being described.
	F is the only accepting state, and every path that reaches it stays there forever, so we don't need a very fancy acceptance condition.
	Some points have multiple representations as infinite strings, but almost all of them don't, so we don't need to worry about them when calculating the area - formally, we are describing the points of the shape such that neither the x nor the y coordinate can be expressed as $a \cdotp 2^b$ where a and b are integers. The excluded subset has measure 0, so this does not affect our calculation of the area.
	
	Every open subset of the unit square can be described in this manner, if infinitely many states are allowed.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Non-deterministic Automata}
Overlapping shapes can be described by non-deterministic automata where each node may have multiple (or zero) edges with a given label. In this case we don't need a separate state for empty squares - if a corner of a node is empty, it may simply have no outgoing edges with that label.

For our purposes, any given non-deterministic automaton may be converted to a deterministic automaton by having a node in the new one for every set of nodes in the old one. The node corresponding to a set $S$ should have an edge labeled $l$ to the set of all nodes in the old automaton with edges labeled $l$ from some element of $S$. All sets containing the full node $F$ may be collapsed into one, with edges to itself.

\section{Describing the Pythagoras tree using an automaton}
One way to look at the Pythagoras tree is as 4 copies of itself, together with the 3 squares in the depth 2 rendering.

That is, the Pythagoras  Tree is the least fixed point of the function sending a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the union of 4 copies appropriately rotated and scaled together with the 2 squares from the depth-2 rendering.

The tree may be divided into 28 squares in a $7\times4$ grid so that the largest square in the tree exactly fills one square of the grid. The 4 copies described above are nicely aligned to a subdivision of the grid, allowing each square of the grid to be described as it 4 corners, each of which is either full, empty, a triangle, or an overlapping combination of squares of the original grid and their rotations. For example, the top-left corner of cell labeled B is a scaled down copy of the cell labeled C (from the yellow subtree) overlapping a scaled down copy of the cell labeled W (from the orange subtree).

This lets us construct a non-deterministic automaton describing the shape. The cell labeled B has tl-transitions to the cells C and W, tr-transitions to D and X, bl-transitions to E and Y and br-transitions to the cells F and Z. The transitions to C,D,E and F come from the yellow subtree and those labeled W,X,Y and Z come from the orange subtree.

As rotations can be multiples of $90^\circ$, we need 4 states needed for each of the 28 original cells. For example, the cell labeled Y has a tr-transition to a state corresponding to Z rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise.  The transitions from rotations are straightforward given the transitions from the originals. This gives a nondeterministic automaton with $4\times28+4+1 = 117$ states (the initial 28, their rotations, 4 triangles and 1 full square). This can be transformed into a deterministic automaton with $2^{116}+1$ states, but fortunately not all of them are needed. Instead we can start from the 28 singleton sets representing squares of the grid and discover that ${\sim}10000$ states are reachable from those, which can be reduced to ${\sim}1000$ by accounting for rotations and reflections.

This gives a system of linear equations for the area of the shape described by each state. This system of equations has exactly one solution, from which we can add up the values corresponding to the 28 squares to obtain the area of the Pythagoras tree.

Noting that the area of the closure of the Pythagoras tree would also be a solution to that system of linear equations (it is also a fixed point of the function and does not exceed the $7\times 4$ grid), the fact that there is a unique solution implies that taking the closure does not change the area.

\section{Details of the calculation}


\section{Further results}
\subsection{Area of the filled Pythagoras Tree}
An alternative definition of the Pythagoras tree includes triangles between the squares.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
	\draw[color=lightgray, step=0.5] (-3.2,-0.2) grid (4.2,4.2);
	\draw[color=gray, step=1] (-3.2,-0.2) grid (4.2,4.2);
	\tikzstyle{tsty}=[fill=black]
	\filledtree{\depth}
\end{tikzpicture}

This requires a small change to the automaton and has an area of $80605706690966227797244468721167282379053\over 5025557197283613113718784555470007578789$ ($\approx 16.039$).

\subsection{Area of the Lévy C curve}
We can also use this method to find the area of the Pythagoras tree with the internal triangles filled in, and to calculate the area of the Lévy C curve.

In the case of the Lévy C curve, we need a slightly different setup. Squares known to be filled don't enter the system of linear equations, so the resulting family of solutions have a scaling parameter that can be maximized while ensuring that no unit square described by the automaton has an area larger than 1. This reveals that at the scale of the other diagrams, the Lévy C curve has an area of $9/4$. More conventionally, it might be scaled so that the ends are 1 unit apart, in which case the area becomes $1/4$.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
	\draw[color=lightgray, step=0.5] (-3.2,-0.2) grid (4.2,4.2);
	\draw[color=gray, step=1] (-3.2,-0.2) grid (4.2,4.2);
	\tikzstyle{tsty}=[fill=black]
	\gtree{9}{}{\bounding}
\end{tikzpicture}

You may question why we can just use the largest solution which gives no piece a larger area than it covers. The variables in the equations can be interpreted as areas of any subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ which is equal to two appropriately rotated and scaled copies of itself. This includes the empty set, so to answer this, we need a precise definition of the Lévy C curve:

Let $d_0$ be the transformation which rotates 45 degrees anticlockwise and scales by $1/\sqrt{2}$ centered on $(-1,1)$
and let $d_1$ be the transformation which rotates 45 degrees clockwise and scales by $1/\sqrt{2}$ centered on $(2,1)$.
Given an infinite string $(a_i)$ in $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$, pick any point $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, let $f(a)$ be the limit of the sequence $p,\ d_{a_0}(p),\ d_{a_0}(d_{a_1}(p)),\ d_{a_0}(d_{a_1}(d_{a_2}(p))),\ \dots$. This limit is independent of the choice of $p$. The Lévy C curve is the set  $\{f(a) : a \in \{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}\}$.

This is equivalent to defining it as the intersection of an infinite sequence of shapes, starting with the (closed) 7x4 rectangle that contains the Pythagoras tree and continuing  with 4 copies of the previous iteration, transformed by $d_0\circ d_0$, $d_0\circ d_1$, $d_1\circ d_0$ and $d_1\circ d_1$. 

After selecting the largest solution to the system of linear equations which assigns no variable a value greater than 1, note that any variable to which 1 has been assigned must correspond to a square for which all of the corners also fill their area ($1=(a+b+c+d)/4$ and $a,b,c,d\le 1$, imply that $a=b=c=d=1$). We can show that all points in any such square lie within the shape, therefore it should have area 1. Assume, seeking a contradiction, that some point $p$ in this square ($Q$) lies outside the shape. Considering the fractal as an intersection of an infinite sequence, $p$ must be outside some depth-$d$ iteration. Since each finite depth iteration is closed, $p$ has a ball of radius $r>0$ around it which is also not part of that finite depth iteration (and thus is not part of the fractal). This ball contains some grid-aligned square ($q$) of side-length $2^{-n}$ (with $n$ an integer large enough that $2^{-n}\sqrt{2}<r$, $n>d$ and $q$ is smaller than $Q$) which contains $p$. The square $q$ does not correspond to a variable of our system of linear equations, because it lies outside the depth-$d$ iteration of the fractal, so corresponds to a region of area zero. Since $q$ is inside $Q$, this contradicts the above claim that every subsquare of a square assigned area 1 must also be assigned area 1 when applied inductively. Therefore every point in a square assigned area 1 is part of the Lévy C curve and we have chosen the correct solution to the system of linear equations.

If the the Lévy C curve in fact had area 0, the system of linear equations would have had exactly 1 solution in which all variables were 0. An example of this will is seen in \ref{sec:chaos}.

\subsection{Fractal dimension of the boundary of the Pythagoras Tree}

Using the solution to the system of linear equations from \ref{sec:automaton}, we can tell which squares contain an area of the Pythagoras tree equal to their size. These squares contain none of the boundary of the closure of the Pythagoras Tree. If we alter the automaton by replacing all nodes corresponding to such filled squares with the empty node, the remaining squares all contain some part of the boundary. The remaining automaton doesn't describe all of the boundary - there are some horizontal or vertical edges of squares that are missed. However, horizontal and vertical edges are in bijection with scaled down diagonal ones, all of which are included, so the fractal dimension wouldn't change by including them.

The area, a 2 dimensional quantity, was a solution to the system of linear equations $A_Q = \Sigma_{q\in\mathrm{corners}(Q)} {A_q\over 2^2}$ (with some squares also having known areas). Assuming that the boundary has a well defined fractal dimension $d$, there will be a solution to $A_{d,Q} = \Sigma_{q\in\mathrm{corners}(Q)} {A_{d,q}\over 2^d}$ (with variables corresponding to empty squares set to 0), in which each variable is assigned the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the corresponding subset of $[0,1]^2$.

The approximate value of $d$ can be found by binary search. The system of linear equations for a candidate $\delta$ can be treated as a recurrence relation. If these are iterated with a value $\delta<d$ (starting from any assignment which is strictly positive on variables corresponding to non-empty squares), they eventually reach a state from which all values decrease (and would continue to decrease indefinitely). Similarly, if $\delta>d$, then iterating the recurrence relation reaches a state from which all values increase.

\subsection{Accurate image of the Pythagoras Tree}
Solving the system of linear equations for the area gives the fraction of each square occupied by the Pythagoras for any resolution which is a power of 2. This allows us to create a bitmap with more accuracy than would be obtained by rendering some finite depth version.

\subsection{Chaos game}

The rule is ``move by half the distance towards a random point of a hexagon on the unit circle, such that the chosen point isn't to the right of the last point and isn't to the left of the 2nd last point". Formally we take 6 functions $d_0,\cdots, d_5$ which take a point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and send it towards each of the 6 corners. Then consider sequences $(a_i)$ in $\{0,\cdots,5\}^\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $i$, $a_i\ne a_{i+1}+1\ (\textrm{mod }6)$ and $a_i+1\ne a_{i+2}\ (\textrm{mod }6)$. 

Define $f(a)$ to be the limit of $p,\ d_{a_0}(p),\ d_{a_0}(d_{a_1}(p)),\ d_{a_0}(d_{a_1}(d_{a_2}(p))),\ \dots$ where $p$ is any point in $\mathbb{R}^2$, noting that the choice of p doesn't affect the limit.

For this fractal, we divide an equilateral triangle into 4 equilateral triangles, rather than dividing a square into 4 squares, but the process is not very different. The containing shape is a hexagon rather than a rectangle.
