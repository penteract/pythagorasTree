Let A be the area of the whole tree.

let O be the area of the intersection between the left subtree and right subtree(all of which occurs within a teardrop shaped region).

A = 2*(A/2) - O + 1
therefore O = 1

Let B be the region between the branch of the tree which alternates
Left,Right,Left,... and its mirror (Right,Left,Right,...). To make it include O, it includes the corners of squares which overlap with other brances (the corners have areas 1/8th of the relevant squares)

A = 3 + 2*(7/8)+3*B
14.35 <= A <= 14.63


B can be split into a right isoceles triangle of squares, the largest of which has area S, another smaller (1/16 area) right isosceles triangle facing it (sharing the point of the right angle) with the same density as S, and a pair of trapesia. The trapezia together with half the small triangle occur in shrinking copies up to the edge.

B = S*2 + (T+S/16)*2*4/3

A corner of the trapesium can be rewritten in terms of other pieces, leaving a parallelogram (with area P):
T = P + (7/8)*(1/64)*2 + (T+S/16)/16*2-(S/16)/16/2 + (3/2)*(1/64)

The overlap measured by O occurs in S, (but not the smaller copies of S on the sides), in the shrunk reflection of S, (in proportion (1/16) to the occurence in S) and in T.

B = k*2-1

k = (B/4 + 1/8 + (1/16)*(7/8)*2)*2 + (1/4/8)

teardrop:
D = 2T+S+S/8
D <= 2+1/4+7/64
D >= O (=1)
